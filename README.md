# 📊 Project: Global Smartphone Industry Insights (2025)

Designed and Structured the Dataset:
Cleaned and organized global smartphone data in SQL, defining schema fields for price, RAM, storage, camera, battery, OS, and performance metrics for over 100 devices across multiple brands.

Performed In-Depth SQL Analysis:
Utilized SQL queries to generate descriptive insights — brand-wise averages, price segmentation (Budget/Mid-range/Flagship), and calculated new analytical columns such as value_score, performance_score, and battery_efficiency.

Applied Data Transformation and Normalization:
Implemented CASE statements and min–max normalization in SQL to create standardized KPIs like normalized_performance_score (out of 100) and performance_level for consistent cross-brand comparison.

Developed Interactive Tableau Dashboards:
Built an end-to-end visualization dashboard in Tableau Public to showcase trends in pricing, performance, battery, and value-for-money; included dynamic filters by brand, OS, and price category for deep exploration.

Delivered Actionable Market Insights:
Identified that mid-range Android smartphones offered the best balance between performance and price in 2025, providing clear, data-driven insights into brand competitiveness and emerging market trends.
